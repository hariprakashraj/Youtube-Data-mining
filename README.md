The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project consists of the following components:

**_i)Streamlit Application:_** A user-friendly UI built using Streamlit library, allowing users to interact with the application and perform data retrieval and analysis tasks.
    
**_ii)YouTube API Integration:_** Integration with the YouTube API to fetch channel and video data based on the provided channel ID.

**_iii)MongoDB Data Lake:_** Storage of the retrieved data in a MongoDB database, providing a flexible and scalable solution for storing unstructured and semi-structured data.

**_iv)SQL Data Warehouse:_** Migration of data from the data lake to a SQL database, allowing for efficient querying and analysis using SQL queries.I used PostgreSQL in thois project.
    
**_v)Data Visualization:_** Presentation of retrieved data using Streamlit's data visualization features, enabling users to analyze the data through tables.
