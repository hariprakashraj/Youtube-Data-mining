Introduction

YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project that aims to allow users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. The project utilizes SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit to create a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, store, and query YouTube channel and video data.

Project Overview

The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project consists of the following components:

i)Streamlit Application: A user-friendly UI built using Streamlit library, allowing users to interact with the application and perform data retrieval and analysis tasks.
    
ii)YouTube API Integration: Integration with the YouTube API to fetch channel and video data based on the provided channel ID.

iii)MongoDB Data Lake: Storage of the retrieved data in a MongoDB database, providing a flexible and scalable solution for storing unstructured and semi-structured data.

iv)SQL Data Warehouse: Migration of data from the data lake to a SQL database, allowing for efficient querying and analysis using SQL queries.
    
v)Data Visualization: Presentation of retrieved data using Streamlit's data visualization features, enabling users to analyze the data through charts and graphs.
